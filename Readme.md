regenerating the private key back.

**Language**

Python 3.6

**Libraries Used:**
- Crypto (https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto)

1. Execute Initiator.py and follow the steps appearing on the console.
2. Execute ShareCalculator.py which creates decryption shares (di).
3. Execute DecryptMessage.py for decrypting the cipher text.

Note:
The message in given as input when you execute Initiator.py.
The decrypted message will be shown to the user on execution of DecryptMessage.py.
